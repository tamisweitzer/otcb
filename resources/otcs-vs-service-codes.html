    <h3 class="mt-5">Service Codes</h3>

    <p>You can think of a service code as a code that tells equipment what to do, and tells the biller how to charge the customer each month. This is a  bit of a simplification, but it helps to illustrate the role a service code provides.</p>

          <li>LI035 is a service code that tell the equipment to activate the DVR service, and to charge the customer $12.99 (or current price).
            <br><span style="color: #999; font-style: italic;">A DVR is always made up of at least two services codes: the DVR box code and the DVR service code.</span></li>

    <h3 class="mt-5">One-Time Charge Codes</h3>

    <p>You can think of a one-time charge code (OTC) as a code that describes the type of work order being entered and the type of actions that need to be performed.  In the case of a professinal home visit (PHV), these codes describe to the technician what type of work needs to be done. In the case of a self-install, the OTCs describe what type of equipment needs to be shipped out or picked up.</p>
    <p>Note: Don't get confused by the name! A one-time charge code does not always add a charge to a work order.</p>

        <p>There are subtle, but important, differences between an office-only work order and a self-install work order. This section describes the difference between an office-only work order, a self-install work order, and a truck roll. </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row mt-4">
      <div class="col-12 col-md-4">
        <h4>Office-Only</h4>
        <p>Office-only work order refers to a work order that does not require a tech to go out to the customer's location.</p>
        <p> This work order is almost always closed out immediately after entering it. Examples of office-only work ordes include adding a channel package to an existing cable customer and balancing a cable occurrence. When we describe a work order as "an office-only" instead of "a self install" we are saying that the work order was created to handle one of these scenarios.</p>
        <p>Office-only sales reasons include "Customer Called In", "Account Correction" and "Cost". </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12 col-md-4">  <h4>Self Install</h4>
        <p>A self-install order is a type of office-only work order that includes mailing or picking up equipment.</p>
        <p> A like-for-like swap is a type of self-install order. Self-install orders are closed out by clicking on the Office Only button in CRM because self-install orders are a type of office-only order. </p>
        <p>Self-install sales reasons include "Self Install Ship" and "Self Install Pickup".</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-12 col-md-4">
        <h4>Truck Roll</h4>
        <p>A truck roll is a type of work order that includes a professional home visit.</p>
        <p>This can include upgrades and modification to existing lines of business, and installation of new lines of business. </p>
        <p>Truck roll sales reasons include "Customer Called In", "Correction" and "Cost". </p>
